# WMS Mobile Flutter App

This project contains a basic Flutter application skeleton for a WMS mobile app using `flutter_riverpod` and `go_router`.

## Requirements
- Flutter 3.x SDK
- Dart 3.x

## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter and run `flutter doctor`.
2. Get dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The app uses Material 3 and Riverpod for state management. All network logic and barcode scanning are TODOs.
